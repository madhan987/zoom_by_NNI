# zoom_by_NNI
Zooming an image using nearest neighbour interpolation method.

Nearest neighbour interpolation is the simplest approach to interpolation. 
Rather than calculate an average value by some weighting criteria or generatean intermediate value based on complicated rules, this method simply determines the “nearest” neighbouring pixel, and assumes the intensity value of it.
